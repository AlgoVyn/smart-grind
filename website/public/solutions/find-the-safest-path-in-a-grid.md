# Find The Safest Path In A Grid

## Problem Description
[Link to problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-safest-path-in-a-grid/)

You are given a 0-indexed 2D matrix grid of size n x n, where (r, c) represents:

A cell containing a thief if grid[r][c] = 1
An empty cell if grid[r][c] = 0

You are initially positioned at cell (0, 0). In one move, you can move to any adjacent cell in the grid, including cells containing thieves.
The safeness factor of a path on the grid is defined as the minimum manhattan distance from any cell in the path to any thief in the grid.
Return the maximum safeness factor of all paths leading to cell (n - 1, n - 1).
An adjacent cell of cell (r, c), is one of the cells (r, c + 1), (r, c - 1), (r + 1, c) and (r - 1, c) if it exists.
The Manhattan distance between two cells (a, b) and (x, y) is equal to |a - x| + |b - y|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.
 
Example 1:


Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: All paths from (0, 0) to (n - 1, n - 1) go through the thieves in cells (0, 0) and (n - 1, n - 1).

Example 2:


Input: grid = [[0,0,1],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 2) is cell (0, 0). The distance between them is | 0 - 0 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.
It can be shown that there are no other paths with a higher safeness factor.

Example 3:


Input: grid = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 3) is cell (1, 2). The distance between them is | 0 - 1 | + | 3 - 2 | = 2.
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (3, 0) is cell (3, 2). The distance between them is | 3 - 3 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.
It can be shown that there are no other paths with a higher safeness factor.

 
Constraints:

1 <= grid.length == n <= 400
grid[i].length == n
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
There is at least one thief in the grid.


## Solution

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maximumSafenessFactor(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        dist = [[-1] * n for _ in range(n)]
        q = deque()
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    dist[i][j] = 0
                    q.append((i, j))
        
        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
        while q:
            x, y = q.popleft()
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and dist[nx][ny] == -1:
                    dist[nx][ny] = dist[x][y] + 1
                    q.append((nx, ny))
        
        low, high = 0, max(max(row) for row in dist)
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
            q = deque()
            if dist[0][0] >= mid:
                q.append((0, 0))
                visited[0][0] = True
            found = False
            while q:
                x, y = q.popleft()
                if x == n - 1 and y == n - 1:
                    found = True
                    break
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and dist[nx][ny] >= mid:
                        visited[nx][ny] = True
                        q.append((nx, ny))
            if found:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        return high
```

## Explanation

First, compute the Manhattan distance from each cell to the nearest thief using multi-source BFS.

Then, binary search on the safeness factor s. For each s, check if there is a path from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1) where all cells have distance >= s, using BFS.

The maximum s where such a path exists is the answer.

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2 log n), since BFS is O(n^2), binary search log(max_dist) ~ log(n), each check O(n^2).

**Space Complexity:** O(n^2) for dist and visited.
