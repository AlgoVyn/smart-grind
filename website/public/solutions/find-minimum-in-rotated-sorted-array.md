# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem Description

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated 4 times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

### Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All the integers of `nums` are unique.
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between 1 and `n` times.

## Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        return nums[left]
```

## Explanation

Since the array is sorted and rotated, the minimum element is at the rotation point. We use binary search to find this point efficiently.

1. Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `len(nums) - 1`.

2. While `left < right`:
   - Calculate `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
   - If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`, the minimum is in the right half, so set `left = mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the minimum is in the left half including `mid`, so set `right = mid`.

3. When `left == right`, `nums[left]` is the minimum.

This binary search narrows down the search space by half each time, finding the pivot where the array is rotated.

**Time Complexity:** O(log n), as required.

**Space Complexity:** O(1), using only a few variables.
